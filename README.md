# Blog_v2.0
This is my extended version of my Blogging app created using Django, with user authentication

This was built using Django. I have included the user authentication works like logging in, updating your profile with the profile pics in which you can also upload your own! and also Password reset via email. And you can create your post update it, delete it whenever you need. And you can also have a look at the posts of the specific user in a nice paginated way.

This was deployed on https://myblog-v2-0.herokuapp.com/

*Since this app is deployed on heroku, update profile pic doesn't work because heroku potentially deletes all the medial files, but in background your image is actually changed, but it doesn't have resources to display.*
